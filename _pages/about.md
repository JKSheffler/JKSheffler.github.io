I am a third-year graduate student studying stars and exoplanets in the Ursa Major Moving Group with Dr. Melinda Soares-Furtado. I am currently reading The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson and I am always working to convince people to play Blood on the Clocktower. I also recently began learning to rock climb and sail.
